# CodSoft
Machine Learning Mini Projects Collection
This repository contains four beginner-friendly machine learning projects built as part of the CodeSoft Internship program. Each project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts such as classification, regression, model evaluation, and handling imbalanced datasets.

📂 Projects Included
1. 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction
Predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Skills: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Classification

Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

2. 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction
Predicts IMDB movie ratings using features such as director, actors, genre, and budget.

Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor

Skills: Regression Modeling, Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection

Dataset: Custom dataset (or specify your source)

3. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
Classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using petal and sepal measurements.

Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees

Skills: Supervised Classification, EDA, Visualization
