Titanic Survival Prediction
A Machine Learning project using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Movie Rating Prediction
Built a regression model to predict IMDB movie ratings based on features like genre, director, actors, budget, and release year. This project involves feature engineering, EDA, and model building using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Iris Flower Classification
A classic classification project using the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions. Applied Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees for comparison.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Credit Card Fraud Detection
Built a binary classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an imbalanced dataset. Used techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance and evaluated models using metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
